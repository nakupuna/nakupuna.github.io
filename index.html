  <h1>The Na Kupuna Ukulele Club</h1>
  <div class="color-bar"></div>
  <p>The Na Kupuna Ukulele Club was formed in 1997 by a group of island and mainland born senior citizens for the purpose of fellowship and the love of music. Na Kupuna in the Hawaiian language means elders or seniors. They were one of the 21 groups chosen by the city of Chicago to open Millennium Park in 2004 and have made many appearances throughout Chicago and the near suburbs.</p>
